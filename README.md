# Simplifi - DeltaHacks 2025 
Our project Simplifi is a chrome extension that actively works to scrape text on web pages and simplify them based on user preferences. The extension has 4 available settings: current which is the original webpage, simple, simpler as well as simplest and thus giving the user three different levels of readability for their text. To follow up, if the user has any questions about the content on the page they can ask our chatbot located on our extension. 


## Technologies
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
- API: Cohere AI

## What we Learned
Throughout this project, every team member gained valuable new skills. We explored API integration, leveraged AI to enhance functionality, and worked with cutting-edge technologies like Cohere. These experiences have expanded our technical knowledge and strengthened our ability to develop innovative solutions and collaborate effectively in team settings. 

## What's Next for Simplifi 
We envision Simplifi as a scalable Chrome extension with the potential to tackle a broader range of accessibility challenges. One key improvement we plan to introduce is a text-to-speech feature, allowing users to have the simplified text read aloud directly from the webpage. This enhancement would make Simplifi even more inclusive, catering to users who benefit from auditory learning or have visual impairments.
